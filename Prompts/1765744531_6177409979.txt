Portrait of [person from uploaded photo] as an ancient Egyptian High Priest. They are in the middle of a solemn ritual in the Great Hypostyle Hall of Karnak Temple. Dressed in a leopard-skin robe and holding a ceremonial staff, illuminated by a dramatic shaft of light cutting through the towering columns. Incense smoke creates a subtle motion blur. Epic, cinematic, rich shadows and highlights.
