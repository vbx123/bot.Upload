"Epurelistic environmental portrait of a contemplative tourist standing on the Great Wall of China at Mutianyu. They are dressed in modern, functional outdoor clothing in neutral tones. Their hand is gently resting on the ancient, weathered stone of the wall. The wall snakes dramatically over the lush, green mountain ridges into a misty, atmospheric distance. The focus is sharp on the subject's thoughtful expression, with the vast landscape slightly softened. Moody, natural light under a cloudy sky, capturing a moment of quiet awe. --style raw"
