"Dynamic urban portrait on the Westminster Bridge in London. The subject, a stylish urban explorer in a smart coat, is walking confidently with a slight smile, looking towards the camera. Behind them, the iconic Houses of Parliament and Big Ben are in sharp, detailed focus under a dramatic sky. The red double-decker buses on the bridge are a slight, artistic motion blur. The color palette is classic London: grey, red, and black, with a pop from the subject's clothing. Energetic, professional city photography. --ar 16:9"
