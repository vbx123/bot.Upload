Portrait of [the same person from uploaded photo], as a modern Egyptian tourist. They are leaning casually against a low wall at the Giza plateau, wearing stylish casual wear (jeans and a simple top) and sunglasses, with a faint, confident smile. The Pyramids are sharply in focus in the background under a clear blue sky. A blurred camel tour passes by in the distance. Natural light, professional travel photography style, clean composition.
