Instruction (use uploaded images as references): Use the uploaded image(s) exactly as the subject(s). If exactly one image is uploaded, create a single, detailed, hand-drawn pencil sketch of that subject centered on an open notebook page. If multiple images are uploaded, arrange each reference as a separate pencil sketch on the same notebook page — spaced apart so each sketch is visually independent (like a sketchbook with multiple studies on one page). Preserve each subject’s identity and proportions from the photos.
Style & Medium: Photorealistic pencil sketch on textured off-white notebook paper. Use a combination of soft graphite, hard graphite, and cross-hatching. Include: visible pencil stroke direction, pressure variation, subtle eraser smudges and highlights, light bleed of graphite into paper texture, and natural unevenness of hand-drawn lines. Do NOT look like a printed filter or digital trace — ensure hand-drawn imperfections: slight stray lines, pressure-dependent darkness, occasional sketch guidelines, and faint thumb smudges.
Composition & Layout: Place sketches on a lightly ruled or plain notebook page with visible page grain and a faint spiral/stitched binding at the left (or top if portrait). If multiple sketches, arrange them in a balanced grid (no overlap), each with a small handwritten caption area below (leave it empty) and faint pencil registration marks. Slight perspective/foreshortening may be used to make the page look photographed (tilted ~5–12°) but keep sketches fully visible.
Lighting & Finish: Simulate natural overhead daylight on the paper (soft shadows from spirals and slight paper curl). Add subtle paper wear: faint corner fold, tiny coffee-stain-like spot (optional), and realistic paper fibers. Output should be high-detail (fine pencil texture visible at 100% zoom).
Color: Monochrome graphite (black/gray tones). Paper color: warm off-white / very light cream. No colored inks or digital color overlays.
Fidelity instructions: Faithfully reproduce clothing, facial features and pose from uploaded images; do not change gender, ethnicity, or major distinguishing marks. Do not add invented elements (unless user explicitly asks).
Deliverable: Single image file (JPEG/PNG) of the notebook page containing the sketch/es, resolution at least 3072 × 4096 px (or highest available).
Tone keywords (for style guidance): hyper-detailed pencil study; authentic hand-drawn; textured paper; cross-hatching; soft graphite wash; subtle smudge; sketchbook realism.
Negative / forbidden style constraints: no halftone or printed-screen effect; no flat digital filters; no vector line art; no watercolor, no color pencils, no ink lines; no obvious repeating texture patterns; no watermark or signature unless user requests.
If user uploads multiple images: label them in the upload order (Image1, Image2, …). Place them left-to-right, top-to-bottom in that order on the page. Maintain consistent scale (subjects roughly same visual size) unless user asks otherwise.
Optional finishing touch (user choice): If requested, add a tiny, believable artist pencil-signed initial in one corner (handwritten, faint). Otherwise leave clean.
