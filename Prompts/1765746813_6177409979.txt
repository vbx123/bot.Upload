"Cinematic Parisian street portrait of a modern traveler. They are leaning against a vintage, green Parisian street lamp on a cobblestone street (like Rue de l'Université), gazing thoughtfully into the distance. The top of the Eiffel Tower is perfectly framed in the background between classic Haussmannian buildings. They are dressed in chic, minimalist autumn attire (trench coat, scarf). Morning light with long shadows, soft focus on the background buildings to emphasize the subject and the tower. Style of a luxury editorial travel magazine. --ar 4:5"
