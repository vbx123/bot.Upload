"Professional travel portrait of a modern tourist with a calm, confident expression, interacting playfully with the Leaning Tower of Pisa. They are wearing stylish, contemporary casual wear (e.g., a well-fitted t-shirt and chinos). The shot is taken from a low angle, making the tower's lean dramatic yet clear in the bright Italian sunlight. The green lawn of the Piazza dei Miracoli and other historical buildings are in the soft-focus background. The scene feels candid and joyful, with natural lighting and vibrant, realistic colors. Shot on a 35mm lens to capture the environment. --style raw --ar 2:3"
