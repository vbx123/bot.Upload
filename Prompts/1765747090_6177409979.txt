"Serene and iconic portrait at sunrise. The subject, a modern traveler in elegant, simple clothing (linen fabric), is sitting on a bench in the Mehtab Bagh gardens, perfectly still. They are in profile, looking at the Taj Mahal reflected perfectly in the long water channel. The white marble monument is bathed in the soft, golden-pink light of dawn, with a slight mist rising. Other tourists are absent or blurred into soft shadows. The composition is symmetrical and calm, evoking timeless beauty. --style raw"
