Create an extraordinary, hyper-cinematic movie frame featuring the person from Image 1 as the central hero in a surreal epic-science-fiction world.
The scene takes place inside an enormous ancient futuristic chamber, a place that feels both mystical and technologically advanced. Towering monoliths with glowing runes rise into darkness above, while soft volumetric light streams down from a circular opening in the ceiling, illuminating the character like they are chosen by fate.
Camera direction:

A low-angle, ultra-wide anamorphic shot (28mm anamorphic), giving the character a monumental heroic presence. The camera captures fine atmospheric haze, floating dust particles, and a subtle halo of light around the subject. Soft cinematic film grain and high dynamic range color grading elevate the realism.
The character (from Image 1) stands on a raised stone platform engraved with ancient symbols. Their clothes transform into a futuristic ceremonial outfit made of dark metallic fabrics, reflective accents, and subtle light-emitting lines. Their expression is calm, powerful, and filled with destiny.
Around them, streams of glowing energy rise from the floor, spiraling upward like a gravitational flux, hinting at powers awakening. The walls shimmer with holographic projections, slowly shifting like living light.
Color palette:

Deep sapphire blues + molten gold highlights, with silver reflections.

A mood that blends mystery, power, and cosmic significance.
Lighting:

Strong overhead god-ray spotlight
Secondary rim-light outlining the silhouette
Soft golden ambient reflections
Filmic contrast with dramatic shadows
The whole frame should feel like it was shot on an ARRI ALEXA 65 with vintage anamorphic lenses, directed by Denis Villeneuve and shot by Roger Deakins — a visually overwhelming, multi-Oscar-level moment.
Final result:

A breathtaking, unforgettable sci-fi cinematic frame capturing the rise of a legendary figure — epic, emotional, and visually impossible to ignore.
